//Comments to Pratima.
1. Approach - My approach towards the class/class inheritence portion was taken because it was the primary way we did it yesterday, and also with the help and guidance of my peers.
2. Problems I had were returning my values, given that I didn't understand how to return a value that didn't have a value(I was unaware that I needed to set the value of x and y elsewhere) and it took awhile to wrap my head around it.
